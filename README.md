# WTT-STORE
Help build the WTT-Store

# Goal
Build only the "frontend" of a non-server book store.

## Write rules:
- React Framework
- Html5 + CSS

## What we are judging:
- Good visual presentation and desirable UX concepts
- Programming Logic
- Organization
- Documentation

## What can I use:
All data should be simulated (no server), preferably create a single static file with all data required in the requirements below.

## How to submit:
Fork this repo and implement your solution. Then send us a pull request to this branch with your code.

## Requirements
- Login page (username e password) - Does not require any authorization validation.
- List of books available in store (minimum of 20 books that can be based on this link https://www.casadocodigo.com.br).
- Each exposed book should have an option for more details, when clicking a page of that book's details should be displayed.
- On the details page, display the book price and option to purchase.
- Once the user clicks "buy", the book should be added to the cart and an option to "check out" should be displayed.
- At checkout, display a form to fill in "name, date of birth and email".
- When submitting the form, display a page stating "Your order has been successfully completed" and thank you for purchasing the book, with an option to return to the beginning of the store.

Good luck!
We are waiting for you on the team!
